# emma-wants-to-code

##Hi! I'm Emma. I'm a designer focusing in on UI. I want to become a Front-End pro so I can get that much closer to a usable end product. I take care of my hermit crab every day, so I'm going to attempt to update this every day with my progress and any resources I've found helpful.
